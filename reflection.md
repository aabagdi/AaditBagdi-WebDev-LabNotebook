## Reflection Document

### HTML
These exercises were fairly straightforward. Although I was absent during week 2 due to life circumstances, I was able to finish the exercises on my own. I found that the first exercise was particularly helpful to get the semantics of HTML. I don't think there was anything to be explained better, and I don't think that there are other exercises that could've helped me learn this week's topic better.

### Accessibility
The exercise was fairly straightforward. I was able to finish everything by myself, and I don't think anything could've been explained better and if there were other exercises that could've helped me here.

### CSS
The CSS exercises were a little harder than the HTML ones. I was able to finish most of them, but for some of them (the Flexbox and CSS Grid ones), I got a bit of help from Claude 3.5. I found it a little challenging due to me having to miss class due to health problems. The other ones were pretty straightforward and I used only the class resources to complete them.

### JavaScript
These were very straightforward to me. I finished these without any help. I found the API fetching one pretty interesting, not because it was hard, but because of it being different compared to my main language, Swift.
