### HTML

These exercises were fairly straightforward. Although I was absent during week 2 due to life circumstances, I was able to finish the exercises on my own. I found that the first exercise was particularly helpful to get the semantics of HTML. I don't think there was anything to be explained better, and I don't think that there are other exercises that could've helped me learn this week's topic better.
